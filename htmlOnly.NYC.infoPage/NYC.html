            The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions, and in the 1880s, New York City
            theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring a new stage form that became known as the

            Cuisine
        </h4>
        <p>
            New York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant
            history. <br> Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions,
            brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (delis) to the city. Italian immigrants
            brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants
            brought pastrami and corned beef, respectively. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints,
            trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city.
