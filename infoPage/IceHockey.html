    <h1>More about ice hockey in NYC</h1>
    <p>The metropolitan area is home to three National Hockey League teams. The New York Rangers, the traditional
        representative of the city itself and one of the league's Original Six, play at Madison Square Garden in
        Manhattan. The New York Islanders, traditionally representing Nassau and Suffolk Counties of Long Island, play
        in UBS Arena in Elmont, New York, and played in Brooklyn's Barclays Center from 2015 to 2020. The New Jersey
        Devils play at Prudential Center in nearby Newark, New Jersey and traditionally represent the counties of
        neighboring New Jersey which are coextensive with the boundaries of the New York metropolitan area and media
        market.</p>
