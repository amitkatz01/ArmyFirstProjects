<!-- This is the time for your first assignment!
Open a folder in your VS Code and add to it an html file and a css file.
Link the css file to the html file.
Now, build a website about yourself:
Where are you from,
how old are you,
where did you go to school. 
Try using as much of different html elements as you can.
You HAVE to use flex-box principle and :hover selector at least once..
Add pictures and design it as pretty as you can.
This should take about 5 hours.
BONUS - Use some css animation OR use media queries
Examples (They are complicated - this is not what required of you. But it can give you ideas) - -->
